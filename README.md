Simulation of Bike Share Networks
=================================

The goal of this project is to:
* Predict ...
* Optimize ...

Running Files
-------------
We've modularized our entire directory. 
In order to run any program you'd
have to use this syntax: `python -m <sub-dir>.<file-name>`. For example,
if you want to run `views/app.py`, invoke `python -m views.app` from
the `simulation` base directory.

Style Guide 
-----------
Here's a tentative style guide we should try to follow when creating
new files, directories and when writing code. This guide closely follows
PEP8 (The Official Style Guide for Python Code). Feel free to modify it.

#### File and Directory Naming Conventions

* File/Directory/Module names should have short, all-lowercase names. 
  Underscores can be used in such names if it improves readability.

#### Code Naming Conventions

* CamelCase should be applied to class names.

* Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
  as necessary to improve readability.

* The function naming style can also be applied to method names and 
  instance variables.

* Constants should be written in all capital letters with underscores
  separating words.
